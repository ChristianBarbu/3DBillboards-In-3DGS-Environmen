# 3DBillboards-In-3DGS-Environment
This is an adaptation of Aras Pranckeviƒçius implementation of the rendering part of 3DGS. It employs some additional changes to facilitate the interpolation between two Gaussian scenes. However, the scenes need to be prepared for this to work properly.

## Models used in Thesis
As the assets and PLY files are generally very large, here is a Onedrive link, where the PLY files, as well as the already converted files for Unity have been placed:

## Successive Gaussian Training
The following commands can be used for successive training.
1. Pass:

```shell
python train.py -s <path to first COLMAP data> --iterations N --densify_until_iter N -m <first output> -r 4
```

2. Pass:
```shell
python train.py -s <path to second COLMAP data> --iterations M --densify_until_iter N -m <second output> --start_checkpoint <path to first COLMAP data>\chkpntN.pth -r 4
```
